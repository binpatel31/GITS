# Methods
* A google sheet was created for the students to Enroll and fill up slots that they preferred.
* A test plan with detailed list of task was provided in the repository.
* The GITS project was setup on the sandbox and each Participant was provided with a seperate [Sandbox](https://bit.ly/32xYiwM) environment.
* The participants performed tasks in both GIT and GITS.
* We used google sheets to note timings of various tasks and a google form to understand the familiarity of participant with GIT.

# Materials
* Sandbox
* Google Forms
* Zoom

# Observations
We did two types of observations: Manual and Post Evaluation with Google Form. The Manual Observation is recorded by a member from our group while the Post Evaluation form was filled by the users.

  ## Manual Evaluation
  We had two metrics to determine how easy it was for the participants to complete the tasks. The two metrics are Time taken and No of times the document was referred.
  
  ### Time Taken
  The following image represents the time taken by 10 participants to perform each task.

  ### No of times Documentation was Referred
  The following image represents the no of time the document was referred by 10 participants to perform each task.

  ## Post Evaluation
  
  
# Conclusion
# Threats to Validity
 * Since all the participants had a good knowledge of Git, as they have been using it for quite a long time now, time for performing with GITS and traditional GIT may differ for a person who is unfamiliar with any of these tools.
