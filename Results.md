# Methods
* A google sheet was created for the students to Enroll and fill up slots that they preferred.
* A test plan with detailed list of task was provided in the repository.
* The GITS project was setup on the sandbox and each Participant was provided with a seperate [Sandbox](https://bit.ly/32xYiwM) environment.
* The participants performed tasks in both GIT and GITS.
* We used google sheets to note timings of various tasks and a google form to understand the familiarity of participant with GIT.

# Materials
* Sandbox
* Google Forms
* Zoom

# Observations
We did two types of observations: Manual and Post Evaluation with Google Form. The Manual Observation is recorded by a member from our group while the Post Evaluation form was filled by the users.

  ## Manual Evaluation
  We had two metrics to determine how easy it was for the participants to complete the tasks. The two metrics are Time taken and No of times the document was referred.
  
  ### Time Taken
  The following image represents the time taken by 10 participants to perform each task.

</p>

  #### Analysis
  * For Task 1, we found that GITS takes less time as compared to git as it requires less number of commands to perform that specific task.
  * For Task 2, as many participants are more familiar with GIT, it took less time to perform entire task. Similar trend can be observed in the analysis for # of times documentation referred for GITS in Task 2 where participants took more time to understand the commands and it's examples.
  * For Task 3, we see that two participants took less time to perform task as they are expert in GIT. The same thing is reflected in the post evaluation form for those two participants.
  * For Task 4, it is similar to what we observed for task 2. It took them more time to refer new commands which were introduced in GITS.
  
  ### No of times Documentation was Referred
  The following image represents the no of time the document was referred by 10 participants to perform each task.

  </tr>
</table>
  
  #### Analysis
  * For Task 2,3 and 4 we can see that the number of times documentation referred in GITS is more as compared to GIT. Since participants are very familiar to GIT, they are aware of most commands and thus they don't need to refer the documentation much.   
  
  ## Post Evaluation
  We had two metrics to determine how easy it was for the participants to complete the tasks. The two metrics are Familarity with Git vs Documentation Referred and Ease of comprehending documentation.
  
  ### Familarity with Git vs Documentation Referred
  The following image represents the familarity with GIT on X-axis while the Y-axis represents the number of times documentation was referred 
  for GIT and GITS.
  
  <img src="https://github.com/ultraultimated/GITS/blob/master/images/Familarity%20with%20Gits%20Vs%20Documentation%20Referred.png">
  
  Participants familiar with GIT had the background knowledge of git commands and found it easy to complete the tasks with Git. However, they spent a little more time to complete the tasks with GITS as the name of the commands were newly introduced and had to look into every command to figure out its purpose. So we can conclude that participants with background knowledge of git were more efficient and would not want to switch to GITS to perform the same tasks.
  
  
  ### Ease of comprehending documentation
  The following image represents how easy/hard users felt to find relevant information in the documentation.
  <img src="https://github.com/ultraultimated/GITS/blob/master/images/Ease%20of%20comprehending%20documentation.png">
  
  Participants found it easy to find external help to complete the tasks with. That is, they felt that the documentation was clear enough with examples and intuitive to perform the tasks. While the participants found the relevant commands difficult to find when executing the experiments with GITS. This shows that the documentation for git is better than GITS and intuitive.
  
  

# Conclusion
* It was observed that overall the participants took less time in doing tasks in GIT as compared to GITS. The reason for this is because the participant is more familiar with GIT and have first hand experience in GIT.
* Participants took less time for task 1 because, Git required two commands to perform a task which could be done in 1 command in GITS.
* 
# Threats to Validity
 * Since all the participants had a good knowledge of Git, as they have been using it for quite a long time now, time for performing with GITS and traditional GIT may differ for a person who is unfamiliar with any of these tools.
 * The data is collected only of 10 particpants which may not be enough to draw strong conclusions.
